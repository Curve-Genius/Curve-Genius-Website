                            <a href="../Math/">Our models</a> use statistics that are mathematically sound and simple to understand. 
                            We designed out curving calculator to be more than a magic box with inputs and outputs: it's important to us that 
                            everyone can understand how the program works and find the configurations that work best for them. 
                            We're happy to answer questions and are always looking for ways to improve our website.

                        <p>Our website was first imagined when our founder, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/varun-rodrigues" onclick="return confirm('This link will take you to an external site (linkedin.com)');">Varun Rodrigues</a>, observed a common problem in classrooms. 
                            He noticed that traditional grading curves punished hard working students when one student achieved a particularly impressive mark, 
                            especially in college level courses where class averages may be very low. 
                            Beyond that, he saw that high scoring students were often shamed for their achievements, outcast for "ruining the curve." 
                            It was creating a negative feedback loop and a discouraging environment for all.

                        <p>Convinced their was a better way, Varun saught to understand how teachers curve tests, and noticed that their methods were lacking mathematical motivation. 
                            Through discourse with his dedicated teachers, Varun discovered that many teachers were aware of the issue, but didn't feel mathematically equipped to solve it.
                            Varun began working on a website that could help teachers tackle the issue, while also helping spread knowledge of statistics.
